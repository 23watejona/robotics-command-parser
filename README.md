# ROBOTICS COMMAND STRUCTURE GENERATOR
# AUTHOR: Jonathan Waters

The purpose of this package is to allow for easier/more human-readable command structuring for the Command Based Java template of the FRC competition.
Using Python style indentation, it removes much of the boilerplate java required to generate command structures.
The output is legal, unformatted, java, and consists of a Class with a variety of static methods that each return a Command
My goal here was to make the simple parts of command structuring simple, while also maintaining the ability to do more complex tasks


## The script
Single and multi-line java comments are supported throughout the script
At the top level of indentation, you can define a method using any legal java method name
Indenting in from there, we start to define the command structure for that method. This can take 2 forms:
1. pure-java Method
2. command structure
You may only use 1 of these per method.

### Java Methods
Java Methods are defined by java\*{ ...java code }\*
These do not use the built-in command structuring of the scripting language,
This just allows for valid java to be added
You are responsible for returning a valid command
Note: single-line comments, all beginning and trailing whitespace, and newlines will be stripped in the output
Note: you must also provide the 
Example:
**
sampleJavaMethod()
	java\*{
		if(doThis){
			return new oneJavaCommand();
		}else{
			return new otherJavaCommand();
		}
	}\*
**

### Command Structures

Command Structures consist of 3 major parts(options?)
1. structures
2. commands
3. methods(kinda)

#### Structures
Structures are the built-in command-based structures from WPILib: SequentialCommandGroup, ParallelCommandGroup, ParallelRaceGroup, and ParallelDeadlineGroup
In the scripting language, each of these is broken down to a more readable name, respectively: sequential, parallel, parallelRace, and parallelDeadline
To place commands, structures, or methods, within a structure, simply place them indented underneath, like in python
Example:
*
sampleStructureMethod
	sequential
		doOneCommand
		doNextCommand
		parallel
			doThis
			andThis
			atTheSameTime
*

#### Commands
These are the team-specific commands you have written, and will be given a more human-readable name(more on this later)
They accept parameters in 2 different types of ways
In both cases, separate paramaters are separated by spaces, and are given in the order you expect them to go into the command
Types:
1. any text that contains no spaces
2. anything, with or without spaces, contained within braces {}

Example:
*
sampleStructureAndCommandMethod
	sequential
		humanReadableCommand 100000 stringParameter {any random text I might need :)}
		otherHumanReadableCommand
*

#### Methods
While self-referencing methods defined in the script is not automatically allowed, you can define scripting names for them
and add the ability to parse them when you generate the grammar
right now, there is no capability to pass parameters to these methods
otherwise, you can basically treat them the same as commands

#### Timeouts
In command-based, an often useful feature is to add a timeout to any command or structure
In this language, you can do that as well, by adding "with timeout {amt of time}" to the end of the line of the command or structure you want it to be used on

## Generating a grammar for your team's specific commands
To generate a grammar, the function accepts 2 parameters, both of which are JSON texts:
1. A Command List
2. A Function(Method) List

### The Command List
Each command is defined as an entry in the JSON, see below for format, anything surrounded by a star you must define

*
{
"\*FullLegalJavaName\*":{
	"name": "\*name you want to use for scripting\*"
	
	
}
}
*
